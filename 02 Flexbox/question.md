Create a sidebar with the following components:

- A placeholder for a logo on the top.
- 4 links for the navigation right after the logo
- The avatar and the username in column centered at the bottom.

The sidebar should have a size equal to 200px in width and should occupy the entire height of the page. Add a picture of the sidebar that you created in the folder, as a final result. The 4 links must have a color text (#2b2b2b) and should change into #2b2bb2 on hover, with a transition of 0.3 seconds. Use Flexbox CSS property to manage the layout.

**Suggestion:**

In order to move the avatar and the username at the end of the sidebar, assign the property `flex: 1` to the link list.
